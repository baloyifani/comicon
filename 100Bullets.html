        DC Comics' mature readers imprint, the house of Vertigo was built on the foundations laid by the British Invasion of the 1980s and early 1990s - gothic, surreal, and typically supernatural horror stories that could never fit in the superhero-centric DC Universe. And for years after the imprint's inception, that remained the zeitgeist. The Vertigo "genre" was a broad one, and allowed for many excursions, but it was never hard to identify stories that fit the Vertigo mold. Surprisingly, for the longest time that model didn't include much noir.
        Though most of what Vertigo published had an aura of darkness, there were few, if any, straight forays into the crime/noir tradition. Sandman Mystery Theatre was a steadfast exception, with 70 issues of adventures based firmly in the pulp vein, but even that series lacked the hard edge of real crime fiction. For the first decade and a half of its existence, Vertigo lived off the model established by the Brits, and stuck to that even when there weren't many Brits left for the publisher to hang its hat on. Vertigo seemed to realize that in the late 1990s, and through a series a short stories, one-shots, and limited series, subtly influenced the imprint's focus to matters of the street. In 1998, the dark, quirky, and violent Jonny Double teamed writer Brian Azzarrello with Argentine artist Eduardo Risso, and all the elements were in place to enact a dramatic shift in Vertigo's publishing line.
