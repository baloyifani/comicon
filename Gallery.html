With looks deep into the heart of everyday people affected by Superman, Superman himself, Lois, and even Lex Luthor, we reach a better understanding of how Superman sprung from a public consciousness that just needs a hero. If you can read this story and not fall in love with the character, well, you’re probably hellbent on taking over the world.</p></td>

It reintroduced the Joker as a much more dangerous psychopath than we’d seen in years, but also told personal stories of family, fathers and sons, and whether Bruce Wayne could ever be whole again.</p></td>

Kevin Smith and now Marvel CCO Joe Quesada relaunched the character under the Marvel Knights imprint, bringing old hornhead back to the streets in stories that featured religion, drugs, murder, suicide; a lot of things that superhero comics didn’t touch very often (especially in the ‘90s). When David Mack brought Brian Michael Bendis on board as his co-writer, Bendis would segue that into an epic run of his own on the series, teamed with artist Alex Maleev in giving readers the most noir and personal look they'd seen at Daredevil since Born Again. The modern Daredevil TV series owes a lot to that run, as does Marvel-Netflix as a whole.</p></td>

The new volume of the ongoing series so drastically changed the DCU, it’s safe to say we wouldn’t see any comics published today from DC Comics the same way without it. It was here that Johns introduced the ideas of the emotional spectrum and more Corps of lanterns that could harness other emotions. It could very easily be argued that this storyline moved Johns into the level of prominence that now has him as Chief Creative Officer and President at DC Entertainment, and co-head of DC Films, so this one is as far-reaching as they come. It also happens to be damn good comics.</p></td>
